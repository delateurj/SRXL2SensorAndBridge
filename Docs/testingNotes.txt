RX: AR637T
TX: Dx9
Core: Teensy 3.1/3.2
Power Sequence: Tx then rx/teensy simultanseus (Teensy power connected to port 6 of rx)

Port Used: 4 pin srxl2
Log File Name(s):test001.txt
Repeatability: High, 8 times in a row, same result.  Have not seen different result.
Results Summary:
Logging via Serial usb port has some issues.  Comm #8 doesn't print new line.  
Comms 9-140 don't arrive to monitor.
Order of rx and tx's are not correct to what actually happened.  For example:
Comm 4 actually happened before Comm 3 which is Teensy's reply to Comm 4.
We also have the general problem that every Teensy TX will show up as an RX as the TX and RX lines are connected.

After 346ms Teensy sends handshake.
RX replies within 5ms.
Teensy sends its device info
RX starts sending handshakes starting with device id 21, then 30 (we don't reply), rest is lost in usb comm issue.

At 1884 ms RX sends what appears to be first cd packet but not clear due to comms issue.  All zeroes

At 6044 ms RX starts sending non zero servo values in CD packets

At 7234,8442,9608,10818,12000 and apprxoximately every 1200 ms Teensy receives CD with matching ID (30) and replies with telemetry

Telemetry connection bars are intermittment...seems to brief flash into connected state with same frequency as Teensy sending telemetry.

Results:
Same as above but now get telemetry displaying on transmitter correctly and updating at the 1200ms freq.
Note: Needed to delete RPM entry by setting to empty prior to auto-config to get data to display.
Note: RPM is delayed since TX does averaging and takes approximately 30s before it starts to display.
Assume it take that long to get minimum number of values required by TX algorithmn

Results:
Similar to above for first 8 seconds then get telemetry requests about every 22ms and my device replies but telemetry link to tx is lost on both Dx9 and ix20
